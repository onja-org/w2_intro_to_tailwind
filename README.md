List of messages, with a user profile picture, username, and message

### Bonus features

- Using the given colors from tailwind does not match Discord completely. Create custom CSS classes in a CSS file to use matching colors

    Discord primary color: #202225
            secondary color: #2f3136
            tertiary color: #36393f

    Example: 
        CSS File

        .bg-primary {
            background-color: #202225;
        }

        HTML/Tailwind
        class="other classes... bg-primary ...other classes"
